# Self-Teaching-Piano
The piano file is the code needed to be uploded to one of your aduino's and will change the output sound based on the button you pressing essentially creating a paino. The ardunino light button will need to be uploaded to another arduino and it controls LEDs that should be placed above each button, the order the lights flash allow for the user to play simple songs like twinkle twinkle litte star.
